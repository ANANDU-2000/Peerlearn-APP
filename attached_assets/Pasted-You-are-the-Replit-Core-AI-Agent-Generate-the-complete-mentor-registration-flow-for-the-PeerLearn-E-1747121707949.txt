Route: /signup/mentor  
Role: mentor  
Method: multi-step form with full validation, DB save, toast alerts, error handling, and redirect on completion.

Layout (Web):  
- Centered card, fixed width (max-w-xl), white background, shadows, rounded-lg  
- Progress bar (Step 1 of 5) at top  
- Form fields below with “Next ▶” and “Back ◀” buttons  

Layout (Mobile):  
- Fullscreen step layout  
- Sticky bottom nav (Back, Next)  
- Step indicator + validation at top  
- Smooth transition animations via Alpine.js

Form Steps:
1. *Basic Info*  
   • Full Name (text), Email (email), Password (masked)  
   • Real-time: green tick or red border  
   • Validate: email format, uniqueness, strong password  
2. *Domain Expertise*  
   • Multi-tag input (e.g. Web Dev, Data Science)  
   • Suggestion list, spell correction  
3. *Skills & Certifications*  
   • Multi-select dropdowns  
   • Auto-complete suggestions  
4. *Bio & Qualifications*  
   • Textarea input with word count limit  
   • Optional academic tags  
5. *Profile Picture & Intro Video*  
   • File input with preview  
   • Validate type (jpeg/mp4) and size  
   • Optional intro video link (YouTube allowed)

Final Step:  
- Submit → Save data to CustomUser with role='mentor'  
- Fields: name, email, password (hashed), domain_expertise[], skills[], bio, qualifications, profile_image, video_url  
- DB: SQLite3  
- Toast: “Mentor profile created successfully ✔”  
- Redirect: /dashboard/mentor

Error Handling:
- Email exists = inline “Email already registered ❌”  
- Empty required field = red border + shake effect  
- Image upload fail = toast “Image upload failed ❌”  
- DB save fail = modal retry with fallback  
- If user refreshes, show popup: “Resume registration?” with saved draft (localStorage via Alpine.js)  
- On logout or connection lost = alert: “You're offline. Changes will be saved once reconnected.”

Security:  
- CSRF token in form  
- Password hashed before save  
- Server-side validation backup for all fields

UX Details:
- Input height ≥44px  
- Buttons = Tailwind bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700  
- Success = green check animation  
- Alpine transition between steps (slide-left, slide-right)

Redirect Logic:
- If role is not mentor → redirect to appropriate dashboard after login  
- After submit: auto login → /dashboard/mentor
