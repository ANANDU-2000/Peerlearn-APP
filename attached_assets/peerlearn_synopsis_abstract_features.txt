Synopsis
--------
PeerLearn empowers learners to discover and join live sessions on any topic, from programming to biology, through a streamlined interface with â‰¤4 clicks for core actions. Mentors can create public sessions, respond to private live requests, and host peer-to-peer video lessons with features like whiteboard, chat, and screen sharing. The system uses Django Channels for real-time notifications, Redis for caching, and Celery for background tasks (reminders and feedback prompts). A multi-step registration wizard ensures accurate profiles, while ML-based interest/expertise embeddings feed personalized recommendations. Admins manage users, sessions, payments, and feedback through a dedicated dashboard.
