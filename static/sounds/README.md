# Notification Sounds

These sound files are used in the WebRTC room for notifications:

- `alert.mp3`: Used for general notifications and alerts
- `success.mp3`: Used for positive feedback (e.g., connection established)
- `error.mp3`: Used for error notifications

These are placeholder MP3 files. For production, you should replace them with proper audio files.
